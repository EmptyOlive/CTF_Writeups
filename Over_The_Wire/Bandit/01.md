# Method of Solve
read file name -
cat ./-

# Notes
the reason you need put either < or ./ before the file name is because The cat command treats a filename of - as a special case,
interpreting it as a request to read from standard input rather than from a file.
This behavior is defined by the POSIX standard for cat. When cat encounters - as an argument, it does not attempt to open a file
named - but instead reads from the standard input stream, which is typically the terminal or a redirected input source.
This convention allows cat to seamlessly handle input from pipes or redirections without requiring a separate file name.
If you need to work with a file literally named -, you must use an explicit path to avoid this special interpretation.
For example, using cat ./- will read the contents of a file named - in the current directory, as the ./ prefix prevents the 
shell from treating - as a special argument.Similarly, using cat -- - can also be used to explicitly indicate that - should be 
treated as a filename rather than a signal to read from standard input, although this relies on the utility supporting 
the -- convention for ending options
